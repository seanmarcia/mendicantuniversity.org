Gregory Brown will be running a 90-minute study session on technical writing in
late May or early June. This session will focus on the general challenges
involved in communicating complex ideas through writing, and does not require
any special background in a particular field. Both experienced and 
inexperienced writers are welcome to participate!

To make sure that those attending the session have some common ground to
start from, Gregory has put together a [preliminary writing task](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/17/task-for-the-upcoming-technical-writing-session) 
that should be completed by all those who wish to participate in this 
activity.

While the exact date and time for the study session has not yet been set, 
the deadline for the preliminary exercise is May 24. Please [see the task
description](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/17/task-for-the-upcoming-technical-writing-session) for more details.

No matter what kind of work you do, improving your understanding of the
fundamentals of technical writing will make you a better 
teacher AND a better learner. This session will hopefully be the first
of many on this very important topic.

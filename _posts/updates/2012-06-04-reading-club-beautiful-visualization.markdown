Starting today, Rafa de Castro is organizing a small reading group for the book [Beautiful Visualization](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000617.do).
We will start with the third chapter, [publicly available online](http://blog.wordle.net/2010/05/wordle-as-beautiful-visualization.html)
so nobody has to buy anything in advance. We will discuss the chapter in 
[the new forums](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/26/beautiful-visualization-chapter-3-wordle).

We will try to read one chapter a week (they are short, don't be afraid) and discuss the
chapter we read the week before. Anyway do not feel forced to follow the schedule. Just
try to have a enjoyable pace and have fun with the discussion.

The art of displaying lots of information in a meaningful way is a skill that everybody
can benefit from having, not only programmers. Everybody is invited to drop by and discuss.

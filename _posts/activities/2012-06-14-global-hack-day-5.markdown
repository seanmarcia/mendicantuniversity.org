Many programming groups have periodic hack nights where folks get together and work on their own projects while sharing questions and ideas with one another. Recently, we've been trying to do something similar here at Mendicant University, but on a global scale.

If you'd like to show off one of your own projects, get a code review, or possibly help others with their projects, please join us on Thursday June 14 between 18:00 - 02:00 UTC. How long you stick around is up to you, we welcome folks who just want to drop in and say hello as well as those who are looking for an eight hour long coding marathon.

If you plan on participating, add your name and what you want to work on to [this wiki page](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Global-Hack-Day-5). If you don't have a project to work on, list yourself anyway to let folks know you'd be willing to help them with their work.

The only important thing is that you come ready to work. That means either bringing your own code to hack on and discuss, or volunteering to help others with their projects, either by reviewing their code/ideas or by sending them some patches. Save the trading of cat pictures and horrible MIDI files for some other time and place. :-P

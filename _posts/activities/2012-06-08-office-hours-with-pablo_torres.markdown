Hello everyone. I took the core skills course here at Mendicant University last January. Since then I've been looking for more opportunities to discuss code with others and help with what I can - and thus I will be holding office hours this Friday.

If you have questions about backend development, especially in either Python or Ruby, please stop by this Friday, 8 June, from 15:00 to 17:00 UTC - I'll be happy to help!

If you are interested in holding your own office hours, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request. [More instructions here](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/How-to-post-an-activity-to-mendicantuniversity.org).

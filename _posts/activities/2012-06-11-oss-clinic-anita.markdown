> *Good news everyone!*

Now that you'll be reading the remainder of this Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth voice. Are you new to Open Source and looking for a project to get your feet wet with? Are you a veteran programmer looking to have some fun? Do you just want to hack? Well then, join us the week of June 11 for Mendicant's first Open Source Software Clinic featuring our new, potentially lovable, IRC bot [anita](https://github.com/mendicant/anita).

So, what's an Open Source Clinic you ask? It's similar to our hack days, but focused on a single project. The goal is to not only get pull requests, but to help programmers new to open source get their bearings in a friendly, helpful environment. All you'll need to do to get involved is, fork the project, add a new feature and send a pull request. On Friday, June 15 we'll feature your contributions in the Unicorn's Horn.

If you're you'd like some help starting the process, Shane will be holding an open session on Monday June 11, 2012 from 14:00-16:00 UTC in the #mendicant channel on IRC. There we can discuss how Anita works, how to contribute to OSS or anything else that comes up.

Anita is pretty bare bones right now, so there's a lot of different things you could do. It could be something fun like [mustachifying pictures of Greg](http://i.imgur.com/KVFJH.png) or more serious, like adding authentication or activity support. Anita is a traditional IRC bot, but she also has a web interface. So if you'd like to do some web development, that is possible too. Whatever you're interested in is fair game; this is the community's IRC bot, so have fun!

If you are interested in running your own OSS Clinic, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request.

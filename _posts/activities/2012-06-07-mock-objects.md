During our last [study session on
TDD](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/05/06/tdd-notes.html), Gregory Brown and Eric
Hodel were reminded of an awesome talk that Gregory Moeck gave on mock objects
at RubyConf 2011. That eventually lead them to hunt him down to run this
followup session!

If you are interested in test-driven development in general and mock objects in
particular, please join us on June 7 from 23:30 - 01:00 UTC for a group
discussion. We will reflect on Gregory's talk
([video](http://confreaks.com/videos/659-rubyconf2011-why-you-don-t-get-mock-objects),
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/gmoeck/p/why-you-dont-get-mock-objects)) and surely go off
on various tangents related to the general theme.

This study session will be as much about software design as it is about software testing, so be sure to put your object-oriented thinking cap on!

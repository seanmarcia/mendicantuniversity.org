On June 19th from 17:00-18:00 UTC, Sean Marcia will be moderating a discussion
on ruby gems. This discussion will encompass gems from the must-haves to the
most unknown. With approximately forty thousand different gems available it
can be an overwhelming task to search through them all to find the ones we
need.

Stop by if you are starting a new project and feel like having a discussion on
what the best gems are for authentication and authorization. Maybe you have
found yourself having to work with excel spreadsheets but beed to write the
data to googlespreads and need gem recommendations. Perhaps you have
discovered a little known gem (sorry, I couldn't resist the pun) of a gem that
you want to share with everyone. Or maybe you are using a well known gem for a
not so well known purpose and want to share.

Everyone is encouraged and welcome to attend, from those of you who are
writing their first "Hello, World!" program to those who have written books
titled _Ruby Best Practices_.

It is probably a good idea to be familiar with [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org)
and [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) if you plan on stopping
by.
